A report on Lab 4: Breadboard from a Computer Architecture Course and Hmwk 5 from Operating Systems complete the goal "to attain a system level understanding of the computer." 

  In Lab 4, we built a binary adder, utilized a D-latch, and illustrated certain theorums of boolean algebra. These activities involved reading datasheets for various inverters and gates and understanding processes which form the base of logic in computer hardware and which allow a computer to compute. This lab is detailed in the file lab_4_logic_breadboard and reported under Lab 4 - Report.
  
  Homework 5 consists of a program that runs four task-scheduling algorithms: first-come first-serve, shortest job first, priority, and round robin. These algorithms illustrate four ways in which operating systems might schedule tasks. As scheduling is critical to computer speed, it is relevant to a goal which requires an understanding of the operating system.
  
ProxyServer.java contains a program which acts as a proxy internet server and which fulfills the goal "to understand the concepts and techniques of software design" by illustrating object-oriented programming." The server is an object and holds instances of several other objects including the client connection and a socket connection to an a given webpage. The program itself reads a url from the client and requests data from the corresponding site, writing it to the client.

The file labeled Lab 10, from the course Algorithms and Data Structures, is an instance of a finite state machine for interpreting floating point numbers. Because it was a lab, I began it with a partner; we planned and began to write the code. However, I completed this assignment myself. This code thus illustrates fulfillment of the goal "to acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting."

Spheres generates a ppm image file. It is the result of algorithm design and continuous modification and testing. In this way, it supports the goal "to develop effective problem solving skills." The program uses vectors to generate an image of three spheres. I came up with the original algorthm based on a description of ray tracing and was assisted with modifications.
